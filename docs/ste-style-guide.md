# The writing standard: ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English

Use these rules for every README and for `docs/ste-style-guide.md` in each repository. Copy this file
into the repository as `docs/ste-style-guide.md` and add a **project vocabulary** section (Section 3)
with the technical names and technical verbs of that project.

## 1. The writing rules

### Words

1. Use one word for one meaning, and one meaning for one word. Do not use synonyms for variety.
2. Use a word only as one part of speech. For example, `test` is a noun or a verb, `check` is a verb.
3. Do not use phrasal verbs (`set up`, `carry out`, `find out`, `pick up`, `look up`, `come up with`).
   Use one verb: `prepare`, `do`, `find`, `get`, `make`.
4. Do not use an `-ing` form as a noun or an adjective (`the running job`, `after indexing`).
   Exception: a technical name, a file name, a command or a status value.
5. Do not use contractions (`don't`, `it's`, `can't`). Do not use slang or idioms
   (`out of the box`, `under the hood`, `at a glance`, `gotcha`, `bells and whistles`).
6. Do not use `and/or`. Write `A, B or both`.
7. Do not use `should`, `could`, `would` or `may` for instructions. Use `must` for a rule, the
   imperative for a step and `can` for a possibility.
8. Keep the articles `a`, `an` and `the` in sentences.
9. Do not make a noun cluster of more than three words. A technical name is one word.

### Sentences

1. A procedural sentence (an instruction) has a maximum of **20 words**.
2. A descriptive sentence has a maximum of **25 words**.
3. Write one instruction in one sentence.
4. Use the imperative for an instruction: `Run the tests.` Not `The tests should be run.`
5. Use the active voice. Use the passive voice only when the agent of the action is not important.
6. Use only the simple present, the simple past and the simple future.
7. Put a condition before the instruction: `If the index is stale, build it again.`
8. Do not use semicolons in sentences. Write two sentences.

### Paragraphs, notes and warnings

1. A paragraph has one topic and a maximum of **6 sentences**. Start with the topic sentence.
2. A warning or a caution starts with a clear command. Then it gives the reason.
3. A note gives information. It does not give an instruction.
4. Use a vertical list for a sequence or a set of conditions. Each item of a numbered procedure is one step.

### Tables, headings and diagrams

1. A table cell can be a short phrase. If a cell has a sentence, the sentence obeys the rules.
2. A heading is a noun phrase (`The cost model`) or an imperative (`Run the demo`).
   Do not start a heading with an `-ing` form.
3. A diagram label is a short phrase. Use the same terms as the text.

### What STE does not change

Code, commands, file names, paths, field names, environment variables, status values, enum values,
product names and URLs stay exactly as they are. They are technical names. Put them in backticks.

## 2. General words to replace

| Do not use | Use |
|---|---|
| utilize, leverage | use |
| in order to | to |
| set up | prepare, install, configure |
| carry out, perform | do |
| make sure, ensure | make sure (allowed), or `check that` |
| a lot of, lots of | many, much |
| e.g., i.e. | for example, that is |
| should (instruction) | must (rule) / imperative (step) |
| might, may (possibility) | can |
| very, really, just, simply, easily | (delete) |
| seamless, robust, powerful, blazing | (delete or give a measured fact) |

## 3. Project vocabulary

This section gives the technical names and the technical verbs of snaptranslate. The README uses each term with only this meaning.

### 3.1 Technical names (nouns)

| Term | Meaning | Do not use |
|---|---|---|
| **source text** | The text to translate, typed or read by OCR | input string, query |
| **source language** | The language of the source text, as a canonical code | from-language, input language |
| **target language** | The language of the output | to-language, output language |
| **canonical code** | The one code in `languages.py` for a language, for example `zh` or `zh-Hant` | ISO code (alone), locale |
| **language pack** | A Tesseract traineddata file, for example `deu` | model (for OCR), dictionary |
| **first pass** | The OCR read with the Latin packs when the source language is not known | draft OCR, pre-read |
| **detector** | `BuiltinDetector` or `LangdetectDetector` | classifier, identifier |
| **backend** | One translator behind the `Translator` interface: `marian`, `nllb`, `llm`, `glossary` | engine, provider (for a translator), model |
| **router** | `Router`: it selects the first available backend for a pair | dispatcher, selector |
| **pair** | A source language and a target language | direction, combination |
| **status** | The `status` field of a `TranslationResult` | state, outcome, result code |
| **approximate output** | Glossary output, word by word, with a coverage value | translation (for glossary output), estimated meaning |
| **coverage** | The share of source words that the glossary knows | confidence, accuracy |
| **model cache** | `ModelCache`: the LRU store of loaded models | model pool, memory |
| **session history** | `SessionHistory`: the bounded list of results of one session | chat history, log |
| **test set** | A JSONL file of sentences with one reference each | dataset, benchmark data |
| **reference** | The correct translation of one test sentence | gold, ground truth, target sentence |
| **condition** | The noise on the source text in a benchmark: `clean`, `ocr-native`, `ocr-eng` | scenario, setting |
| **baseline** | `CopySource`: the system that outputs the source text | dummy, naive model |

### 3.2 Technical verbs

| Verb | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **normalise** | Change any language code or name into the canonical code |
| **detect** | Give a canonical code and a confidence to a text |
| **read** | Get text from an image with OCR |
| **prepare** | Change an image to gray, stretch the contrast, binarise and upscale it |
| **route** | Select the backend for a pair and call it |
| **translate** | Change a source text into the target language with a backend |
| **score** | Calculate BLEU and chrF against the references |
| **export** | Write the session history to a JSON file on request |
